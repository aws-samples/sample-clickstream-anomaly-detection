Expected user journey violated - cart action without prior product interaction suggests frontend async operation race condition or event tracking system batching issues.\n- Affected Events:\n  - Seq 1003: add_to_cart at 1757018174129\n  - Seq 1003: product_view at 1757018175976\n\nThis anomaly requires immediate analysis to determine if it indicates a technical issue, security concern, or user experience problem that needs resolution."
